                the glidein pool, i.e. it will run the Condor Collector and Negotiator daemons. These daemons define the glidein pool; if this node
                dies, the pool dies with it.

            <p>
                The machine must be <b>very stable</b>; if the Collector dies, the glidein pool dies with it (There are Condor techniques to 
                minimize this damage, but you should still try to choose the stablest machine you can afford.)

        The installer will ask for several DNs for GSI authentication.  You have the option of using a service certificate or a proxy.  These should be
        created and put in place before running the installer.  The following is a list of DNs the installer will ask for:
        <ul>
            <li>Pool Collector cert/proxy DN</li>
            <li>User Submitter cert/proxy DN</li>
            <li>Glidein Factory cert/proxy DN</li>
            <li>VO Frontend proxy DN (cannot use a cert here)</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Note:</strong> In some places the installer will also ask for nicknames to go with the DNs.  For the most part the name given doesn't 
        really matter.  There is one case where is does matter.  If you are using privilege separation, then, on the WMS Collector, the nickname for 
        each VO Frontend must be the username that you created for the frontend. <br>
        <strong>Note 2:</strong> The installer will ask if these are trusted Condor Daemons.  Answer 'y'.

    <div class="section">
    <h2><a name="condor">5. Installation instructions</a></h2>
    <P>
        The pool Collector can be installed either as root or as a non privileged user. Either case, make sure that the user has access to the 
        needed <a href="gsi_config.html">GSI credentials</a>.  There is no real advantage to install as root, so non-privileged installation is 
        recommended if installed separately.
    </p>
    
    <p>The whole process is managed by a install script described below.</p>

    <p>Move into</p>
    <blockquote>glideinWMS/install</blockquote>

    <p>and execute</p>
    <blockquote>./glideinWMS_install</blockquote>
    
    <p>
        You will be presented with the service selection screen. Choose [4] for the user pool collector, and f
ollow the instructions and install all the software components. Further detail and a walk-through is presented below:

		the collector to work with the submitted glideins.<br/>
		For this, you will need a condor distribution and a location to install to.  It will also
		prompt for a administrator email.

Installing pool collector

Installing condor


You will now need the Condor tarball
You can find it on http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/
Versions v7.2.2 and 7.3.1 have been tested, but you
should always use the latest one

Where do you have the Condor tarball? <b>/home/collector/downloads/condor-7.4.2-linux-x86_64-rhel5-dynamic.tar.gz</b>
Checking...
Seems condor version 7.4.2

Where do you want to install it?: [/home/collector/glidecondor] <b>/home/collector/glidecondor</b>
Directory '/home/collector/glidecondor' does not exist, should I create it?: (y/n) <b>y</b>
Installing condor in '/home/collector/glidecondor'

If something goes wrong with Condor, who should get email about it?: <b>admin@my.org</b>
Extracting from tarball
Running condor_configure
Installing Condor from /home/collector/glidecondor/tar/condor-7.4.2 to /home/collector/glidecondor

Condor has been installed into:
    /home/collector/glidecondor

Configured condor using these configuration files:
  global: /home/collector/glidecondor/etc/condor_config
  local:  /home/collector/glidecondor/condor_local/condor_config.local
You should look inside the installation log for some details about how
Condor was installed.
Created scripts which can be sourced by users to setup their
Condor environment variables.  These are:
   sh: /home/collector/glidecondor/condor.sh
  csh: /home/collector/glidecondor/condor.csh

Do you want to split the config files between condor_config and condor_config.local?: (y/n) [y] <b>y</b>

The Condor config has been put in your login files
Please remember to exit and reenter the terminal after the install

Condor installed

Configuring GSI security

GSI security relies on a list of trusted CAs
Where can I find the directory with the trusted CAs?

Do you want to get it from VDT?: (y/n) <b>y</b>
Do you have already a VDT installation?: (y/n) <b>y</b>
Where is the VDT installed?: <b>/home/collector/vdt</b>
Using VDT installation in /home/collector/vdt

To use the GSI security for Pool Collector, you either need
a valid GSI proxy or a valid x509 certificate and relative key.
Its subject (i.e. DN) will be added as the trusted daemon
in the condor configuration.

Will you be using a proxy or a cert? (proxy/cert) <b>cert</b>
Where is your certificate located?: <b>/home/collector/grid-security/servicecert.pem</b>
Where is your certificate key located?: <b>/home/collector/grid-security/servicekey.pem</b>
My DN = '/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=collector/master1.my.org'


You will most probably need other DNs in the condor grid mapfile.
The User Schedd(s) and Glidein startds will connect to
and act as daemons to the Pool Collector. Any other node or process
that needs to talk securely with the Collector (like the
VO Frontend) also needs to be authenticated, but not as
a daemon. Finally, if you expect any processes on this node
to use condor security toward other nodes (e.g. the VO Frontend
talking to the WMS Collector), the remote services will also
need to be authenticated. The subjects (i.e. DNs)
for these services will thus most likely be needed.

Please insert all such DNs, together with a user nickname.
An empty DN entry means you are done.
DN: <B>/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=schedd1.my.org</B>
nickname: [condor001] <B>submit</B>
Is this a trusted Condor daemon?: (y/n) <B>y</B>
DN: <B>/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=gfactory/gfactory1.my.org</B>
nickname: [condor002] <B>pilot</B>
Is this a trusted Condor daemon?: (y/n) <B>y</B>
DN: <B>/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=frontend/frontend1.my.org</B>
nickname: [condor002] <B>frontend</B>
Is this a trusted Condor daemon?: (y/n) <B>n</B>
DN: <I>enter</I>
What name would you like to use for this pool?: [My pool] <B>TestPool</B>
How many slave collectors do you want?: [10] <B>10</B>
