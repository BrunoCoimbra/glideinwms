    <h3><a name="software_httpd">3.2 HTTP Server</a></h3>
    <p>
        The glidein Factory needs a HTTP server, like <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> or 
        <a href="http://www.stllinux.org/meeting_notes/2001/0719/tux/intro.html">TUX</a>.  The server should be installed on 
        the same node, but a different node can be used as long as the web area is writable from this one. Servers often come 
        pre-installed with HTTP server software, so if you have one running, just reuse it.  Otherwise, the installer can help 
        you install one (as root).  (See <a href="glidein_component_install.html#system_httpd">GlideinWMS Component Install</a>) 
    </p>
    
    <h3><a name="software_rrdtool">3.3 RRDTool</a></h3>
    <p>
        You will also need the python module for <a href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/">RRDTool</a> (v1.2.18 or later). Many 
        systems come with packages for it; if possible use that.  Otherwise see

    </p>

    <h3><a name="software_m2crypto">3.4 M2Crypto</a></h3>
    <p>
        You will need the <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/m2crypto">M2Crypto python library</a>. A few systems include it in the 
        software distribution; if possible install the system one.  Otherwise see 
        <a href="glidein_component_install.html#system_m2crypto">additional install notes</a> for alternative installs.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="software_javascriptRRD">3.5 javascriptRRD</a></h3>
    <p>
        You will need the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/javascriptrrd/">javascriptRRD package</a>.  It contains the 
        javascript libraries needed by the monitoring.  Just download the tarball (with flot), and untar it.  You will need to 
        point the installer to this directory.

    <h3><a name="before_install_certs">4.2 Required Certificates/Proxies</a></h3>
    <p>
        The installer will ask for several DNs for GSI authentication.  You have the option of using a service certificate or a proxy.  These should be
        created and put in place before running the installer.  The following is a list of DNs the installer will ask for:
        <ul>
            <li>WMS Collector cert/proxy DN</li>
            <li>VO Frontend proxy DN (cannot use a cert here)</li>

        <strong>Note:</strong> In some places the installer will also ask for nicknames to go with the DNs.  For the most part the name given doesn't 
        really matter.  There is one case where is does matter.  If you are using privilege separation, then, on the WMS Collector, the nickname for 
        each VO Frontend must be the username that you created for the frontend. <br>
        <strong>Note 2:</strong> The installer will ask if these are trusted Condor Daemons.  Answer 'y'. 
    </p>
    
    <h3><a name="before_install_dirs">4.3 Required Directories</a></h3>
    <p>
        When installing the Factory you will be presented with a question asking for the directory location for various items.  The example below puts
        many of them in /var.  All the directories in /var have to be created as root.  Therefore, if you intend on using /var, you will have to create 
        the directories ahead of time.
    </p>
   <p>
	Due to new restrictions on the directory permissions, 
	it is no longer recommended that you install glideinWMS into
	the /home directory of the user.  
   </p>
        
    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> The web data must be stored in a directory served by the HTTP Server. <br><br>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
<pre>
Where will you host your config files?: [/var/gfactory/glideinsubmit] /home/gfactory/glideinsubmit
Where will you host your log files?: [/var/gfactory/glideinlogs] /var/gfactory/glideinlogs
Where will you host the client log files?: [/var/gfactory/clientlogs] /var/gfactory/clientlogs
Where will you host the client proxies files?: [/var/gfactory/clientproxies]/var/gfactory/clientproxies
Where will the web data be hosted?: [/var/www/html/glidefactory] /var/www/html/glidefactory
</pre>

    <h3><a name="before_install_misc">4.4 Miscellaneous Notes</a></h3>
    <p>
        At some point the installer will prompt you for the OSG VDT Client location or if you want to install it.  The installer will install the client
        for you.  (See <a href="glidein_component_install.html">GlideinWMS Component Install</a>)
    </p>
    <p>
        When asked if you want OSG_VDT_BASE defined globally? Answer 'y' unless you want to force your users to find and hard code the location.
    </p>
    <p>When asked if you want to enable Match authentication, if you are using Condor 7.1.3 or later, answer 'y' unless you have a reason not to.</p>

This will also populate the /etc/condor/privsep_config file for Condor privilege separation with the following values:
	<ul>
	<li> valid-caller-uids and valid-caller-gids. These lists specify users and groups that will be allowed to request action from the PrivSep Kernel. The list typically will contain the UID and primary GID that the Condor daemons will run as.</li>

		You will next need a certificate or proxy for the WMS collector.  See <a href="#before_install_certs">the previous section</a> for more information on required certificates and proxies.</a>
		<br/>
		If you are using privilege separation, then, on the WMS Collector, the nickname for

	<td>Collector Configuration</td>
	<td><i>What name would you like to use for this pool?<br/>
		What port should the collector be running?<br/>

		Here is where you give an identifier and port for the collector process.  The collector typically runs on port 9618.  Schedd and other daemons do not have a set port and just use ports in a range determined by the collector.<br/>
		You can also choose how many schedd daemons the master process will start by default.  
		The proper value of this value depends on many factors, including the memory and CPU of the
		server running it as well as the number of jobs submitted and the number of entry points.
		This should be increased enough so that each schedd will not have to handle multiple 
		glidein requests to different entry points from factories simultaneously.  
		The default install of 10 schedds should be enough to handle a site with around 10000 jobs.
		If you are only running hundreds of jobs, you may want to tune this down.

Do you have already a VDT installation?: (y/n) <b>y</b>
Where is the VDT installed?: <b>/home/gfactory/vdt</b>
Using VDT installation in <b>/home/gfactory/vdt</b>

To use the GSI security for WMS Collector, you either need
a valid GSI proxy or a valid x509 certificate and relative key.
Its subject (i.e. DN) will be added as the trusted daemon
in the condor configuration.

Will you be using a proxy or a cert? (proxy/cert) <b>proxy</b>
Where is your proxy located?: <b>/home/condor/security/grid_proxy.wmspool</b>
My DN = '/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Service/CN=gfactory/gfactory1.my.org'


You will most probably need other DNs in the condor grid mapfile.
The VO Frontend(s) will be contacting the WMS Collector
and will interact as daemons. Their subjects (i.e. DNs)
will most likely be needed.

Please insert all such DNs, together with a user nickname.
An empty DN entry means you are done.

    <h2><a name="factory">6. Glidein Factory installation guide</a></h2>

    <p>
        The glidein Factory needs a x509 proxy to communicate with the rest of the world. You have the option of giving the Factory its own proxy, 
        or having the VO Frontend serve up the proxy.  Standard configuration has the VO Frontend serving the proxy.  If the Factory will have its 
        own proxy, you need to create such proxy before instantiating a glidein Factory and then keep it valid for the life of the factory. If used 
        for job submission, this proxy must at any point in time have a validity of at least the longest expected job being run by the glideinWMS 
        (and not less than 12 hours).<br>
        How you keep this proxy valid (via MyProxy, kx509, voms-proxy-init from a local certificate, scp from other nodes, or other methods), 
        is beyond the scope of this document.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>The glidein factory itself should be installed as a non privileged user</b>. The provided installer can be used to create the configuration
        file, although some manual tunning will probably be needed.

    <p>
        If you followed the example above, you ended up with a configuration file in
        <b>/home/gfactory/glideinsubmit/glidein_v1_0.cfg/glideinWMS.xml</b>. Edit this file to suit your needs and than create the factory 
        instance as described in the Manual configuration section below.
    </p>
    
    <p>At this point you can start the factory with</p>

    <blockquote><i>&lt;install dir&gt;/</i>factory_startup start</blockquote>

    <p>where the <i>&lt;install dir&gt;</i> is the one written out by the installation script.</p>

        <b>Warning:</b> Never update the <i>&lt;install dir&gt;</i>/glideinWMS.xml file! Either use the configuration file you used to
        install it, or make a copy of the glideinWMS.xml file and modify that one.
    </p>

    <p>Once you are done editing the work config file, reconfigure the factory with</p>

    <blockquote><i>&lt;install dir&gt;/</i>factory_startup reconfig <i>&lt;work config&gt;</i></blockquote>
