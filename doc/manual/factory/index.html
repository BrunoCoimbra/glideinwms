<h2 class="header">Glidein Factory</h2>
<H2>Description</H2>
<P>A&nbsp;Glidein Factory is the glidein producing infrastructure of
a <A HREF="../index.html">glidein&nbsp;based WMS</A>.</P>


<div class="section">
<H2><A NAME="overview"></A>Overview</H2>
<P><A NAME="glidein_entry_point"></A>The main task of the Glidein
Factory is to advertise itself, listen for requests from <A HREF="../frontend/index.html">frontend
clients</A> and submit <A HREF="../index.html#glideins">glideins</A>.
Look at the picture below for a schematic view.<BR><IMG SRC="overview.png" NAME="graphics1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=881 HEIGHT=359 BORDER=0><BR><BR>A
single glidein factory can handle multiple kinds of glideins, also
called <B>glidein entry points</B> (as they usually point to
different Grid resources). For each entry point, it will advertise a
different class-ad. <BR>Similarly, each request from a frontend
client will affect a single entry point; a frontend will need to
advertise several requests in order to have glideins submitted to all
the desirable resources.</P>
</div>



<div class="section">
<H2><A NAME="philosophy"></A>The Glidein Factory philosophy</H2>
<P>The main idea behind a Glidein Factory is to make the life of a VO
frontend as easy as possible. And to do that, the factory needs to
abstract as much as possible. </p>
<p>
	For starters, the factory itself is the one that knows the details 
of various Grid sites and properly configures the glidein entry points, 
so they will run without any additional knowledge. A frontend only needs 
to know that an entry point exists, and the parameters it takes.
</p>
<p>
	Additionally, the factory also does the submissions themselves. 
The frontend just publishes that it needs some glideins and the factory 
will start submitting them. The only handle the frontend may want to use 
is the ability to regulate the rate of glideins that are sent to the
Grid site. In the current implementation, this can be achieved by
setting the desired number of 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v7.0/2_6Managing_Job.html#SECTION00361000000000000000">idle glideins</A> 
to be kept in the Grid queue.
</p>
<p>
	The <A HREF="../overview.png" TARGET="_blank">typical scenario</A> 
features a frontend with several (hundreds or even
thousands of) user jobs in the queue that is looking for resources to
run them. It will fetch the factory classads, select the ones that
satisfy its needs, and advertise class-ads with requests for those
glideins. If the frontend ever runs out of user jobs, it will
advertise the fact that it does not need those glideins anymore. In
practical terms, this means asking the factory to keep exactly 0 idle
glideins in the queue.</P>
</div>


<div class="section">
<H2><A NAME="implementation"></A>Implementation details</H2>
<H3><A NAME="glidein_daemons"></A>The Glidein Factory Daemon</H3>
<P>The Glidein Factory is composed of several entry points. The
Factory Daemon is really just a small process tasked to start and
monitor the Factory Entry Daemons. See picture in the 
<A HREF="#entry_daemons">next section</A> for a logical overview.</P>
<P>All daemons of a Glidein Factory share the same directory tree.
The root of the tree contains the main configuration files used by
the Factory daemon.</P>
<P>More details about the Glidein Factory Daemon internals can be
found <A HREF="factory_internals.html">here</A>.</P>
<H3><A NAME="entry_daemons"></A>The Factory Entry Daemons</H3>
<P>The Glidein Factory is composed of several Factory Entry Daemons,
each advertising itself and processing the incoming requests. See the
picture below for a logical overview.
</p>
<IMG SRC="entry_points_overview.png" NAME="graphics2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=818 HEIGHT=539 BORDER=0>
<p>All daemons of a Glidein Factory share the same directory tree. The root
of the tree contains the common startup and configuration files,
while each entry point has a few additional configuration files on
its own. Each entry point is completely described by these files on
disk; the Factory Entry Daemons only extract information about entry
point attributes and supported parameters needed for advertising.
When glidein jobs are submitted, only the frontend provided
parameters need to be given to the glidein startup script, as the
script itself will autonomously gather all the other
information.
</p>
<p>More details about the Factory Entry Daemon
internals can be found <A HREF="entry_internals.html">here</A>.</P>
<H3><A NAME="glidein_startup"></A>The glidein startup script</H3>
<P>As said in the <A HREF="../index.html#glideins">overview</A>,&nbsp;
a glidein is essentially a properly configured Condor startd.
However, somebody needs to do that configuration. So we need a job
startup script that will do the work.<BR><BR>A startup script needs
to perform several tasks:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>check that the working environment on the worker node is
	reasonable (else user jobs will fail) </li>
	<LI>obtain the Condor binaries </li>
	<LI>configure Condor </li>
	<LI>prepare the environment for Condor </li>
	<LI>start Condor </li>
</UL>
<P>Given the complexity of the task, and for the sake of flexibility,
it makes sense to split the script in several pieces. So the glidein
job is composed of several pieces, including the startup script
pieces, the Condor binaries, and a base configuration file.
</p>
<p>
	However, having a Grid job with data files can represent a
challenge; each Grid flavor treats data in a different way!
</p>
<p>
	To make the system as general as possible, the Glidein Factory
requires the use of a Web Server to distribute its data. This version
of the Glide based Factory was tested with 
<A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.stllinux.org/meeting_notes/2001/0719/tux/index.html">TUX</A>,
but any other web server should work just well, as only static file
delivery is required.
</p>
<p>
	A general overview of how a glidein
starts up is given in the picture below.</p>
<IMG SRC="glidein_script.png" NAME="graphics3" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=944 HEIGHT=494 BORDER=0>
<p>
The task of the basic startup script (called <tt><B>glidein_startup.sh</B></tt>)
is thus reduced to loading the other files, including the support
scripts, the base config files and the Condor binaries. The list of
files to load is obtained from the Web server as one of the first
steps, making the startup script completely generic.<BR><BR>Please
notice two things. First, all the files transfered over the Web are
signed using <tt><B>sha1sum</B></tt>. This
prevents a hacker from tampering with the files while in transit.
This is especially important for executables and scripts (to prevent
arbitrary code to be executed), but is useful for configuration files
too.</p>
<p>The signature checking is implemented in two steps:</P>
<OL>
	<LI>The signature of all the files to be transfered is saved in a
	file called <tt><B>signature.sha1</B></tt> and
	stored on the Web server. The signature of the signature file is
	then passed as one of the parameters to the startup script.</li> 
	<LI>The startup script loads the signature file from the Web
	server and verifies its signature. All other downloads, including
	the file containing the list of other files, is checked against the
	values in the signature file. See the pseudo-code below.</li>
<PRE>wget http://head.fnal.gov/glidein_g1/signature.sha1
sha1sum <I>known_sha1</I> signature.sha1
if $?!=0 then
 exit 1
fi
grep files_list signature.sha1 &gt; filelist.sha1
wget http://head.fnal.gov/glidein_g1/files_list.lst
sha1sum -c filelist.sha1
if $?!=0 then
 exit 2
fi
for file in files_list.lst do
 wget http://head.fnal.gov/glidein_g1/$file
done
sha1sum -c signature.sha1
if $?!=0 then
 exit 3
fi
<I>launch scripts</I></PRE>
</OL>
<P>The second point I would like to stress are the advantages that
come from using standard Web technologies. Web technologies are
widely used nowadays and there is a plethora of tools that can be
readily used. In our case, we can reduce the network load and speed
startup times by using a Web cache near the worker nodes, if
available. The Glidein Factory was tested with 
<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/">Squid</A>,
but other products should work as well. It is also worth mentioning
that both OSG and gLite has expressed interest in deploying a Squid
server on every Grid site.<BR><BR>More details about the startup
script internals and support scripts provided by the current
implementation can be found <A HREF="glidein_internals.html">here</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="management"></A>Glidein Factory management</H2>
<P>To run a Glidein Factory, you need to perform two steps:</P>
<OL>
	<LI>Create the configuration directories.
	<LI>Run the Glidein Factory Daemon who will internall start the 
	       Entry Daemons.
</OL>
<p>
<B>Warning: Never change the files in an entry point by hand after it has been created!</B>.<BR>
Use the <A HREF="#reconfig_entry">reconfig tools described below</A> instead.
</p>

<H3><A NAME="create_entry"></A>Creating a new configuration directory
tree</H3>
<P>To create an entry point you need:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>the name of the Gatekeeper(s), 
	<LI>the configuration details of the Grid pool(s), 
	<LI>the location of the submit point, and 
	<LI>the loction of the Web server data directory. 
</UL>
<p>
	The directory tree containing the entry points is created by
	launching the command</p>
	<blockquote>glideinWMS/creation/create_glidein</blockquote>
<P>
Another option is to use the <A HREF="../../install/factory_install.html">provided
installer</A>. <BR><BR><A HREF="entry.html">Technical details of the

<p>
<B>Warning: Never change the files in an entry point by hand after it has been created!</B>.<BR>
Use the <A HREF="#reconfig_entry">reconfig tools described below</A> instead.
</p>

<H3><A NAME="run_daemon"></A>Starting a Glidein Factory Daemon</H3>
<P>The glidein factory comes with a init.d style startup script.</P>
<P>Glidein factory starting and stopping is handled by 
</P>
	<blockquote>&lt;glidein directory&gt;/factory_startup
	start|stop|restart</blockquote>
<P>You can check that the factory is actually running with 
</P>
	<blockquote>
	&lt;glidein directory&gt;/factory_startup
	status
	</blockquote>
<P>
See the <A HREF="#monitoring">monitoring section</A> on how to check other info.
</P>


<H3><A NAME="downtimes"></A>Downtime handling</H3>
<P>Starting with v1_3, the glidein factory supports the dynamic
handling of downtimes.<BR>Downtimes can be handled both at the
factory and at the entry level.</P>
<P>Downtimes are useful when one or more Grid sites are known to have
issues (can be anything from scheduled maintenance to a storage
element corrupting user files).<BR>In this case the factory
administrator can temporarily stop submitting glideins to the
affected sites, without stopping the factory as a whole.</P>
<P>Downtimes are handled with </P>
	<blockquote>
	&lt;glidein directory&gt;/factory_startup
	up|down 'factory'|&lt;entry name&gt; [&lt;delay&gt;]
	</blockquote>

<P>If the entry points are linked to an information system (BDII or RESS), you can also 
   use the following command to automatically adjust the downtime based on the information
   provided by that information system (i.e. the entry point will be marked up
   if and only if the information system claims the gatekeeper is accepting new jobs)</P>
	<blockquote>
	&lt;glidein directory&gt;/factory_startup
	infosysdown
	</blockquote>

<P>
<B>Caution</B>: An admin can handle downtimes both at the entry and at
the factory level. <BR>
Please be aware that both will be used.
</P>

<P><BR>Note: Advanced users may also want to have a look at 
</P>
	<blockquote>
      glideinWMS/factory/manageFactoryDowntimes.py
	</blockquote>

<H3><A NAME="factory_info"></A>Getting configuration information</H3>

<P>To get the list of entries defined in the factory, use</P>
	<blockquote>
	&lt;glidein directory&gt;/factory_startup
	info -entries -CE
	</blockquote>
<P>To see which entries are currently active, use</P>
	<blockquote>
	&lt;glidein directory&gt;/factory_startup
	statusdown entries
	</blockquote>

<P>PS: Make sure the whole factory is not disabled, by using</P>
	<blockquote>
	&lt;glidein directory&gt;/factory_startup
	statusdown factory 
	</blockquote>

<H3><A NAME="reconfig_entry"></A>Updating a configuration directory
tree</H3>

The files in an entry point must <B>never be changed by hand</B>, after the directory structure has been created.
<BR>
<P>The reason why manual changes are so problematic are two fold:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>The first problem are signatures. Any change requires the
	change of the signature file, that in turn gets a new signature.
	Since the signature file signature is one of the parameters of the
	startup script, all glideins already in the queue will fail. </li>
	<LI>The second problem is caching. For performance reasons,
	most Web caches don't check too often if the original document has
	been changed; a glidein could thus get an old copy of a file and
	fail the signature check. 
	</li>
</UL>
<P>There is only one file that is neither signed nor cached and can
be thus modified; the blacklisting file called <tt><B>nodes.blacklist</B></tt>.
This one can be used to temporarily blacklist malfunctioning nodes
that would pass regular sanity checks (for example: memory corruption
or I/O errors), while waiting for the Grid site admin to take action.
</P>
<P>
The proper procedure to update an entry point is 
to make a copy of the official configuration file (i.e. <I>glideinWMS.xml</I>)
and run
<blockquote>
	&lt;glidein directory&gt;/factory_startup
	reconfig <I>config_copy_fname</I>
</blockquote>
</P>
<P>
This will update the directory tree and restart the factory and entry dameons.
</P>
<P>
Please notice that if you make any errors in the new configuration file, the reconfig 
script will throw an error and do nothing. So you should never need to worry about
corrupting the installation tree using this tool.
<p>
<B>NOTE</B>: The reconfig tool does not kill the factory in case of errors.
Hence is recommended that you disable any entry points that will not be used.
</p>

<H3><A NAME="localtest"></A>Testing with a local glidein</H3>
<P>In case of problems, you may want to test a glidein by hand. 
</P>
<P>Move to the glidein directory and run</P>
<blockquote>
	./local_start.sh <I>entry_name</I> fast -- GLIDEIN_Collector 
	<I>yourhost</I>.dot,<I>your</I>.dot,<I>domain</I>
</blockquote>
<P>
. This will start a glidein on the local machine and pointing to the
<I>yourhost.your.domain</I> collector.</P>
<P>Please make sure you have a valid Grid environment set up,
including a valid proxy, as the glidein needs it in order to work.</P>

<H3><A NAME="upgrade"></A>Upgrading to a new version of glideinWMS</H3>
<P>
Upgrading a factory configuration tree to a new version of glideinWMS can be done in two ways:
<UL>
<LI>Installing the new glideinWMS code in a separate directory, and create a new configuration
    tree as explained <A HREF="#create_entry">above</A>.<BR>
    The configuration file (glieinWMS.xml) of the existing configuration tree can be used as a
    base for the new one; only the <I>glidein_ name</I> needs to be changed.
    See the <A HREF="entry.html">configuration page</A> for more defaults.
<LI>Overwrite the glideinWMS installation and <A HREF="#run_daemon">reconfig</A>.<BR>
    If getting the code from CVS, a cvs update -r <I>version</I> will update the code.<BR>
    <B>Warining:</B> Check the revision history before doing this. Not all versions are compatible.
</UL>
</P>
<P>
Which option you choose is really up to you; the second one is easier, but the first one is cleaner and easier to revert back.<BR>
</P>
</div>

<div class="section">
<H2><A NAME="monitoring"></A>Glidein Factory Monitoring</H2>
<P>Monitoring is an essential part of any service. One has to monitor
to both maintain the health of the system and to tune the system for
anticipated growth. The various ways you can monitor a Glidein
Factory are described below. 
</P>
<H3><A NAME="monitoring_logs"></A>Log files</H3>
<P>Both the Factory Daemon, the Entry Daemons, Condor-G and the Glideins write
extensive log files. The logs are kept for a week and then deleted.</P>
<p>
<b><u>Log file locations in glideinWMS v2.3.x and earlier:</u></b>
</p>
<P>The Glidein Factory Daemon log files are located in</P>
<blockquote>
	&lt;glidein directory&gt;/log/factory_info.&lt;date&gt;.log<BR/>
	&lt;glidein directory&gt;/log/factory_err.&lt;date&gt;.log
</blockquote>

<P>Each Entry Daemon has its log files in</P>
<blockquote>
	&lt;glidein directory&gt;/entry_&lt;entry 
	name&gt;/log/factory_info.&lt;date&gt;.log<BR/>
	&lt;glidein directory&gt;/entry_&lt;entry
	name&gt;/log/factory_err.&lt;date&gt;.log
</blockquote>

<P>For each client an Entry Daemon is serving, one Condor-G job log is used</P>
<blockquote>
	&lt;glidein directory&gt;/entry_&lt;entry
	name&gt;/log/condor_activity_&lt;date&gt;_&lt;client-name&gt;.log
</blockquote>

<P>Each Glidein also writes a couple of log files, that get transfered back to 
   the factory node after the glidein terminates. The log files are named:</P>
<blockquote>
	&lt;glidein directory&gt;/entry_&lt;entry
	name&gt;/log/job.&lt;condor-g job nr&gt;.out<BR/>
	&lt;glidein directory&gt;/entry_&lt;entry
	name&gt;/log/job.&lt;condor-g job nr&gt;.err
</blockquote>
<P>The Glidein .out files are readable using any text editor, while the .err files
   contain the compressed logs of the condor daemons.<BR>
   Use the following commands to extract that information in simple text format</P>
<blockquote>
	  glideinWMS/factory/tools/cat_MasterLog.py &lt;err_fname&gt;<BR/>
	  glideinWMS/factory/tools/cat_StartdLog.py &lt;err_fname&gt;<BR/>
	  glideinWMS/factory/tools/cat_StarterLog.py &lt;err_fname&gt;
</blockquote>

<P>Note: If you need Condor log files from a still running glidein, use the following 
   <A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v7.2/condor_fetchlog.html">Condor command</A></P>
<blockquote>
	  &lt;condor dir&gt;/sbin/condor_fetchlog -pool &lt;pool collector&gt; &lt;glidein slot name&gt; -startd MASTER|STARTD|STARTER
</blockquote>

<P>The Entry Daemons also summarize the information about completed glideins into</P>
<blockquote>
	&lt;glidein directory&gt;/entry_&lt;entry
	name&gt;/log/completed_jobs_&lt;date&gt;.log
</blockquote>

<p>
<b><u>Log file locations in glideinWMS v2.4 and later:</u></b>
<p>
With the introduction of privilage separation in glideinWMS, location for log files have changed, altough a link to log directory is still maintained from the  &lt;glidein directory&gt;. Location for the log files is controlled through configuration.

glideinWMS uses condor_switchboard to control the access to the log directories. This makes the deployment more secure.
</p>

<H3><A NAME="monitoring_classads"></A>Looking at ClassAds</H3>
<P>As explained in the <A HREF="../index.html#classads">Data exchange
overview</A>, the Entry Point Daemons expose a lot of monitoring
information in the ClassAds sent to the WMS collector. While this may
not be the most user friendly interface, most of the monitoring
information you'll ever need is present there.</P>

<P>On top of the <A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v7.2/condor_status.html">Condor provided tools</A>,
the factory provides two tools to look at the ClassAds; the first one returns a human readable, but limited text, 
while the other provides a complete XML-formated output</P>
<blockquote>
	  glideinWMS/tools/wmsTxtView.py<BR/>
	  glideinWMS/tools/wmsXMLView.py
</blockquote>

<H3><A NAME="monitoring_web"></A>Web monitoring</H3>
<P>The Glidein Factory Daemon and the Entry Point Daemons also create
XML documents on a Web accessible area 
	(see <tt>&lt;<B>glidein</B>&gt;&lt;<B>monitor base_dir&gt;</B></tt> i
on the <A HREF="entry.html#args_global">configuration
page</A>). These xml files contain the same information you would get
by <A HREF="#monitoring_classads">fetching the ClassAds</A>, in
addition to a short summary.</P>

<H3><A NAME="monitoring_history"></A>Historical Web monitoring</H3>
<P>The Entry Point Daemons will also create <A HREF="http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/">RRD
databases</A> and associated graphs for a period of up to one year.
This way, one can easily monitor the evolution of the system.
